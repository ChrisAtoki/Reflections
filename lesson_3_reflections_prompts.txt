When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You might want to use a remote repository when you don't have your 
    main computer or if you are collaborating with others. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You might want to just try something out and not save it. 
    Also if there are multiple people working on one thing, it
    could interfere with another persons work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks is like cloning in GitHub. Clones copy a repository from 
    a remote repository locally. Branches break off from other branches locally.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It is convenient to have for offline viewing and editing.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    You can collaborate without Git or GitHub by working with others in person. it would be easier because replies would be instant, it would be harder because it wouldn't be easy to share files between each other.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    It would be beneficially to have a separate branch when you are working on an expiremental feature or something you want to try out without breaking the working program you already have in place.
